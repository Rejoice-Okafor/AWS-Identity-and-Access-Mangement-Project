# Identity and Access Management Overview

This web service assists you in securely managing user access to AWS resources. It allows you to manage who has access to resources and who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions).
When you open an AWS account, you start with a single sign-in identity that has full access to all the account's resources and AWS services. Using the email address and password you used to create the account, you can log in as the AWS account root user to access this identity.

Features of IAM 
* Used for authentication and authorization of users

* For enabling multi factor authentication.

* With IAM, you can enforce the principal of least priviledge in your organization by granting a user, resource or service only the permission it needs to complete a particular task

* Without disclosing your password or access key, you can give others access to manage and use the resources in your AWS account.

* For applications that run on EC2 instances, you can securely provide credentials by using IAM features. These credentials give your application the ability to access additional AWS resources. S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables are two examples.

## Creating Users on IAM

1. Firstly, sign in to the IAM console at  https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/

2. Under the Access Mangement pane by the left, click on users and then add users

3. Enter the new user's user name  and  select Add another user and enter each additional user's user name if you want to add more than one user. At one time, you can add up to 10 users. This user name is the AWS sign-in name.

4. Select the kind of access you would want these users to want. Choose  **Programmatic access** if you the user requires access  have to AWS CLI, API or Windows Powershell( This will generate an access key which the user must provide during sign in). At the same time, you can choose **AWS Management Console access** if the users require access to the AWS Management Console so instead of an access key this creates a password for the users.

5. Select one of the following options for the console password:

**Autogenerated password** which is a randomly generated password that complies with the account password policy is given to each user( this can be viewed or downloaded on the final page)  or your **Custom Password** where  you enter a password that is assigned to each user.

6. Click on permissions which is next and then asssign permissions to your users. This can be done in three basic ways :

* By adding user to a group with existing permissions. **Note**: Choose this option if you want to add users to one or more groups that already have the required permissions policies.

* By copying permissions from an existing user.

* By attaching policies dirrectly( this option is used when you either want to create your policy from the scratch or if you want to go through the list of AWS policies and attach the one that suits your requirement best). In my case, i attached the policy( *AmazonS3ReadonlyAcccess* directly to my new user)

7. Click next and add tags( optional) which are metadata or key value pairs that tells you more about the user.

9. Select Show next to each password and access key you want to see to view the users' access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys). Click Download.csv to save the access keys, and then save the file in a secure location.

**Note**: *You must give your users this information before they can  use the AWS API and this is the only way for you to see or download the secret access keys. The secret access key and new access key ID for the user should be kept in a safe location because after completing this step, you won't have access to the hidden keys once more*
