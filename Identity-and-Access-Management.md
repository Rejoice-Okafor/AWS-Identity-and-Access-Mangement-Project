# Identity and Access Management Overview

This web service assists you in securely managing user access to AWS resources. It allows you to manage who has access to resources and who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions).
When you open an AWS account, you start with a single sign-in identity that has full access to all the account's resources and AWS services. Using the email address and password you used to create the account, you can log in as the AWS account root user to access this identity.

Features of IAM 
* Used for authentication and authorization of users

* For enabling multi factor authentication.

* With IAM, you can enforce the principal of least priviledge in your organization by granting a user, resource or service only the permission it needs to complete a particular task

* Without disclosing your password or access key, you can give others access to manage and use the resources in your AWS account.

* For applications that run on EC2 instances, you can securely provide credentials by using IAM features. These credentials give your application the ability to access additional AWS resources. S3 buckets and DynamoDB tables are two examples.
