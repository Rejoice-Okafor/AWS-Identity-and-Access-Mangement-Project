## AWS BUDGETS

Reserved Instances (RIs) or Savings Plans aggregate utilization and coverage metrics can be tracked using AWS Budgets. It can be used to establish your monthly cost budget with a fixed target amount to keep track of all costs associated with your account. 

You can createÂ a monthly cost budget with a variable target amount, with each subsequent month increasing the budget target by 5%. Then, configure your notifications for 80% of your budgeted amount and perform an action.
